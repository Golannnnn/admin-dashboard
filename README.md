# admin-dashboard
My seventh project as part of 'The Odin Project' curriculum. 
Here is the live preview: https://golannnnn.github.io/admin-dashboard/

I had a real fun time practising my html and css in this project. 

For the overall layout and the project cards I used grid and for all the other elements I used flexbox.
